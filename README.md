# Euclidean & Extended Euclidean Algorithm

- Java | December 2023 | CUS 1185 â€“ Data Security & Cryptography
- Developer: Aidin Dzaferovic

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Euclidean Algorithm** and the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** in Java to compute:

- The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers
- The **modular inverse** of an integer, which is key to cryptographic systems such as RSA

Developed for a cryptography-focused course, this project highlights algorithmic problem-solving and efficient recursion techniques in Java.


## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Recursive GCD Calculation**  
  Uses the classic Euclidean Algorithm to compute `gcd(a, b)` efficiently.

- **Modular Inverse Finder**  
  Applies the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of `a mod N`, if one exists.

- **Clear Output**  
  Displays meaningful console messages to explain results or errors.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used
**Recursion**
â€“ Both algorithms use recursive method calls to simplify logic

**Modular Arithmetic** 
â€“ Key concept in cryptography, used for modular inverse

**Algorithmic Efficiency**
â€“ Time complexity for both algorithms is generally O(log n)
